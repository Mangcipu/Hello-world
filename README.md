# Hello-world
My first proper repository
Here I am announncing myself as arrived in Github
I will learn Github and use it to the fullest for version control, an aspect of my work that I have struggled with for many many years
With Git, that is over
My project documentation will be managed professionally
I'm looking forward to using Git in my first data science project
All in all Git will be my companion
Thank you Humans for taking time to read about my Git aspirations,
Let's enjoy together
